# b2bCalculator
My first Java application written according with my own idea. It's calculator for freelancers and jober for calculate benefits depending on kind of contract.

## Main assumptions
The application calculates and compares the employer's costs and the employee's earnings for various types of contracts in Poland.

For b2b contracts, different amounts of contributions (ZUS) are taken into account in relation to the equivalent benefit. 

The application saves the calculations in a file located in the folder: C:\Users\USER\MY Documents\b2bCalculator. Calculations of gross values on the basis of net values are performed using recursive methods..
